## Reflection

This was a project to showcase my skills and knowledge in Redux. Project goals included familiarizing myself with Redux documentation for new features.  

One of the obstacles I ran into was replacing state hooks with the Redux state 'shop'. State hooks are very easy and natural for me, so using Redux was initially time consuming getting to understand the documentation and how hooks translate into redux actions. I don;t necessarily prefer Redux as it seemed quite excessive for what I needed to do, but it was a good learning experience in case I need to use it in the future for bigge rprojects.
